# Snippit

Snippit is a Chrome extension designed to introduce students to the world of coding through the medium they encounter most frequently: websites. As our lives increasingly move online, it's essential for young people to become tech-literate early on. Snippit aims to spark curiosity in students and encourage them to develop critical coding skills that will be invaluable in the future.

## Overview

Snippit offers a friendly, guided approach for students to explore the HTML code behind any webpage they visit. When a student interacts with Snippit, the user can use the picker to isolates the specific code snippet for the selected element and provides a simple explanation of how it works. This approach is far less daunting than the traditional "Inspect Element" feature, which can overwhelm beginners with complex and unfamiliar code.
